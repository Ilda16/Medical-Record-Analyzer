 # Medical Record Analyzer

The Medical Record Analyzer is an LLM (Large Language Model) assistant that summarizes, extracts, and classifies health data from clinical notes using Hugging Face models. This model was designed to  support healthcare IT teams and medical staff to simplify their inforamtion and help accelerate patient understanding.
I know that healthcare providers deal with text that may be unstructured and create a disconnect across teams, the model will bridge that gap internally.
